!!! note
    If you've never connected an CH340 device to your computer before, you may need to install drivers for the USB-to-serial converter. Check out our section on "[How to Install CH340 Drivers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers)" for help with the installation.

SparkFun has written a library to work with the u-blox NEO-F9P. You can obtain this library through the Arduino Library Manager by searching for "**SparkFun u-blox GNSS v3**". Find the one written by SparkFun Electronics and install the latest version. Users who prefer to manually install the library can get it from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_v3) or download the .ZIP by clicking the button below:

<div style="text-align: center"><a href="https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_v3/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" class="md-button">SparkFun u-blox GNSS Arduino Library - v3
 (ZIP)</a></div>

 Once you have the library installed checkout the various examples! There are several examples in the library that cover more than just the NEO-F9P. Note that some examples will not apply depending on the modules features. To take advantage of the F9P, we will be looking at the [ZED-F9P folder](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_v3/tree/main/examples/ZED-F9P).
