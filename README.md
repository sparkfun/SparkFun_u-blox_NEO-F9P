[*SparkFun GNSS-RTK L1/L5 Breakout - NEO-F9P (Qwiic) (GPS-23288)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/23288)

The SparkFun NEO-D9S GNSS Correction Data Receiver is a satellite data receiver for L-Band correction broadcast. It can be configured for use with a variety of correction services including u-blox's PointPerfect satellite GNSS augmentation service, which provides homogenous coverage in the contiguous USA and Europe. With a clear view of the sky, especially a clear view to the South, it decodes the satellite transmission and outputs a correction stream, enabling a multi-band high-precision GNSS receiver (such as the u-blox ZED-F9P) to reach accuracies down to centimeter-level positioning without needing a separate RTK or NTRIP correction!

The board is equipped with a USB-C connector so you can hook the board to your laptop and configure the device using u-blox u-center if you want to. We've also equipped the breakout board with two Qwiic connectors, so you can connect it quickly and easily to your favorite development board and control it using our sophisticated u-blox GNSS Arduino Library. An SMA connector is included for a secure connection to an L-Band antenna. Power, I<sup>2</sup>C, UART1, UART2, and SPI are broken out to 0.1" spaced PTH pins. By connecting the NEO-D9S breakout to one of the ZED-F9P's communication ports, you will be able to know where your (or any object's) X, Y, and Z location is to better than an inch, without needing a separate correction source!
